# `GotongRoyong` : Decentralized Waste Management System

## Project Overview
Gotong Royong is a decentralized waste management platform designed to empower communities to actively participate in keeping their environment clean. Leveraging the power of Web3 and blockchain technology, Gotong Royong enables users to report litter, earn rewards, and collaborate on waste management initiatives in a transparent and secure manner. `GotongRoyong` itself is coming from  Indonesian term  translates to "mutual assistance". It's a concept that involves sharing burdens and working together within a community. The word comes from the Javanese words gotong, which means "to lift," and royong, which means "together"
