# `GotongRoyong` Decentralized Waste Management System

## Project Overview
Gotong Royong is a decentralized waste management platform designed to empower communities to actively participate in keeping their environment clean. Leveraging the power of Web3 and blockchain technology, Gotong Royong enables users to report litter, earn rewards, and collaborate on waste management initiatives in a transparent and secure manner.

## Key Features
- Report Litter: Users can easily report litter by snapping a photo and sharing the location through the interactive map. Each report is stored securely on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and accountability.
- Earn Rewards: Users earn points or tokens for every valid report or cleanup effort. These rewards can be exchanged for various incentives, encouraging continuous participation.
- Interactive Map: A real-time map that displays litter reports, ongoing cleanup efforts, and community-driven initiatives, allowing users to see and engage with their local environment.
- Community Engagement: Join forces with other users to tackle larger waste management projects, participate in local clean-up drives, and discuss strategies in the community forum.
- Web3 Integration: Seamless integration with Web3 wallets for secure, decentralized login and reward management, ensuring user data and assets are protected.
